# Potential Project ideas


I want to work on one of the following project ideas

1. A currency exchange system
2. An Army leave processing system
3. An online international shipping system


1.Currency exchange system:

A software that will allow users to buy and sell foreign currencies and try to profit from market fluctuations. The system will use data from previous transactions and current exchange rate from financial institutions to set the rate at which a given currency is traded at. It will store user data, transaction history, and changes in exchange rates. I will only have two trading currencies to begin with, and will expand as more data is collected and analyzed. The two currencies will be US Dollar and Euro. The goal for users will be buying a currency when its value goes down and sell it back when the value increases. The main focus of the application will be analyzing previous transactions to determine if trading in current market condition will yield a profit, or if it would be better to stop trading until market conditions change. For example if I buy 1000 Euro at a rate of $1.2, I will have to wait until rate increases to $1.3 or $1.4 to trade it back to US dollar making a profit of $100-200, vice versa.

2. Army Leave processing system:

A web application that will allow soldiers to submit leave requests online. A soldier will fill out their DA31 online, and upload all supporting documents for their leave. The system will check against the soldier record to make sure that the soldier is not delinquent on anything that will result in a denial of the request. If such delinquencies exist, the application will advise soldier to address those issues before moving forward with the request. If the soldier is current on all training and medical readiness, the request will be forwarded to their platoon sergeant for review. The request will then make its way through the soldier's chain of command. The soldier will have the option to track the request along the way, and update the request if need be.

3. An online international shipping system

A website that provides international shipping services to users. Customers will be able to enter dimensions, pickup location and destinations of their shipments, and receive a quote online.
